ARF-Converter
===========

Bulk ARF file converter.
These programs allows you to easily convert a large amount of ARF files to MP4, WMV or SWF files. ARF files are created by Cisco's WebEx product, a web conferencing software.

 * Documentation is available in the wiki.
 * Comments will be located in the script file for ease of understanding.

# Requirements

These scripts require the nbrplayer to convert the files. You can grab the nbrplayer from here:http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html

Make sure that you download the ARF version!!!

The Python script is written in Python 3.  
You can grab that here: https://www.python.org/
